# Exp-traq

## Cheat sheet for me:

View info about current project:
$ gcloud info

Configure default project:
$ gcloud init 
...and follow prompts (e.g. which login you want to use, which project to apply commands to, etc.). Super easy!

Run project locally:
$ dev_appserver.py ./

Deploy project to Google Cloud:
$ gcloud app deploy
...and follow prompts

## Blah
...testing a change after I've deleted RM's exp-traq project and made Gaylord's project be the main one. Also deleted and recloned the repo on my mac.
